# Agentic RAG Chatbot 🤖

This project is an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using LangGraph and LangChain. It leverages the Groq LLM provider for fast and efficient inference.

The app demonstrates multi-agent orchestration with memory, tools, and retrieval, providing both conversational and specialized AI features.
